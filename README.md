Minitel-Canvas
==============

Minitel Canvas is an Inkscape SVG file for making Minitel pages under a vector editor.

Since Minitel uses Videotex chipsets, you can also design Videotex pages with Minitel-Canvas.

Installation
------------

Before opening the `minitelcanvas.svg` file, install the `minitel.ttf` font file on your system.

Notes
-----

To get a pixel-perfect image, use the Inkscape export image functionality. Other SVG renderer will not be
able to do a good job.

When you export from Inkscape, select 90 dpi which should give you a 320Ã—250 PNG file.

Yellow grid is for the text base line, white grid is for the Minitel grid.

The Minitel is generally avaiable as a black and white terminal though color terminals were available.
Color terminal can not display grey shades. Black and white are common to both.

Demo
----

The Minitel Canvas comes with two demo layers.

You can use [CRT emulator](https://github.com/Zigazou/CRT-emulator) to give it a CRT look and feel.
